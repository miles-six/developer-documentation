# Introduction

Developers can engage with the MXC ecosystem in a variety of ways. These forms of participation are integral to the further development and deployment of the MXProtocol.

## Direct Participation

### Beta Testing
We can greatly enhance the overall user experience with our products by beta testing new features prior to their release. The following are the current beta openings:

| Product | Beta Type | How to Participate |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| DataDash | Closed | [Instructions](tutorials/datadash/beta.md) |
| MXC Controller | Closed | *Coming Soon* |
| M2 Pro (MatchX) | Open | *Coming Soon* |

*A beta version is pre-release and considered unstable. This implies that you may experience some issues. Normally these issues will be minimal, however participating in an M2 Pro beta could potentially affect your mining. MXC Controller and DataDash betas will not have any influence on your overall mining potential.*


### Coding and Translating
We have a number of active issues in our public repositories that might use support. Our team is still growing, and community support is always appreciated, encouraged and in some cases rewarded.

Here is an updated list of repos that you can contribute to. 
* [DataDash App](https://github.com/mxc-foundation/supernode-app) [Flutter / Dart]
  * [Translate the DataDash](https://crowdin.com/project/mxc-mobile-app)
* [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/mxc-foundation/developer-documentation) [Markdown, Javascript]
  * [Translate the Docs Today](https://crowdin.com/project/mxc-documentation)

We will continue to add repositories to this list as we work to increase transparency regarding our code and development process. 

## Manufacturing / Configuring Devices
Without devices  the network has no purpose. As a result, we developed a simple method for manufacturers to join the network, making it possible for their devices to be deployed as a turnkey solution in the MXC ecosystem. 

In order to increase security of the entire network, we've worked with MatchX to develop a novel provisioning concept for LoRa devices. This provisioning process is a requirement for any devices intending to be MXProtocol compatible. We have made this decision as:
1. Device provisioning increases the security of the device data
1. Users will be able to deploy devices without any additional hassle
1. Improve device data integration and compatibility

You can discover more about device provisioning for the MXProtocol in Devices.

## Reporting Issues
Even though we attempt to do rigorous QA before every release, some pesky bugs still slip through. Actively reporting bugs is an extremely important form of participation, and helps us to improve the stability of the entire network. 

You can report bugs in the #bugs channel in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mxcfoundation)

Bugs can also be reported directly as issues in the relevant GitHub Repo:
